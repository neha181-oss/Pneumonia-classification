# Pneumonia-classification
This GitHub project focuses on the development of a Pneumonia Classification model using TensorFlow and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). The goal is to create an efficient and accurate deep learning model that can classify chest X-ray images into two categories: "NORMAL" and "PNEUMONIA."

# Key Features:

# TensorFlow and TPUs:

Utilizes TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library, for building and training the deep learning model.
Leverages Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process, enhancing efficiency.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loads chest X-ray images from TFRecord datasets for both training and testing.
Preprocesses the images, including resizing and decoding, to prepare them for the model.
Class Imbalance Handling:

Addresses the class imbalance in the dataset by assigning weights to each class during training.
Computes class weights dynamically based on the distribution of "NORMAL" and "PNEUMONIA" images.
Model Architecture:

Implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
The model includes separable convolution layers, dense blocks, and dropout layers to enhance its performance.
Training and Evaluation:

Trains the model using a training dataset and evaluates its performance on a validation dataset.
Implements callbacks, including ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping, to save the best model and prevent overfitting.
Monitors metrics such as precision, recall, binary accuracy, and loss during training.
Exponential Learning Rate Schedule:

Adopts an exponential learning rate schedule to adjust the learning rate during training.
Helps in optimizing the model's convergence and generalization capabilities.
Visualization and Analysis:

Visualizes the training history using matplotlib, providing insights into model performance over epochs.
Evaluates the model on a separate test dataset and displays a sample prediction with associated class probabilities.

# Future Enhancements:

Consider incorporating additional advanced architectures such as transfer learning with pre-trained models.
Explore augmentation techniques to further enhance model generalization.
Collaborate with medical professionals for domain-specific model fine-tuning and validation.
# Contributions:
Contributions and feedback from the open-source community are highly encouraged. Whether it's bug fixes, feature enhancements, or new ideas, the project welcomes collaboration to improve the Pneumonia Classification model.

Feel free to star the repository, open issues, and contribute to make this project a valuable resource for the machine learning and healthcare communities!
